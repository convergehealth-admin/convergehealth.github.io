      <h2>Where Strategy Meets Execution</h2>
      <p>
        At Converge Health, I partner with healthcare leaders and investors to turn technology into a true growth driver. After decades leading transformative initiatives at Optum, Anthem, SS&C Health, Landmark, and others, I launched Converge to offer executive-level technology guidance with zero fluff
        <br>—just actionable strategy, deep domain expertise, and results that scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mission is to help healthcare organizations and private equity-backed companies align their tech investments with enterprise value. Whether advising on M&A, building scalable platforms, or unlocking operational efficiency through AI, I work side-by-side with clients to lead, execute, and deliver.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t operate like a traditional consultant—I embed with your team, speak your language, and move with urgency. Because in healthcare, outcomes matter.
        <br>And so does execution.
